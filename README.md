Hi, I’m Jon Ramangwana.
I’m interested in Data analysis.
At present I'm getting to work at a project, excited about learning Firebase, no sql database, for an Android App development project.
I wish to collaborate on data analysis work to provide insights that improve processes.
Though I prefer to focus on Python programming I coded with R, PhP, Javascript, HTML, Java etc. in the past. 
Getting solutions to problems with help of IT gets me excited. I plan to grow as an IT specialist who provides solutions.
This growth may be possible considering my knowledge of tableau, MS excel, relational, non relational databases etc.  Processing, storing, analyzing data to get solutions in the future shall get done with this knowledge. To contact me email jonramangwana@outlook.com.
