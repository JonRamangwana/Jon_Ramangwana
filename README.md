Hi, I’m Jon Ramangwana.
I’m interested in Data analysis.
At present I work at a project, excited about learning Firebase no sql database for an Android App development project.
I wish to collaborate on data analysis work to provide insights that improve processes.
I focus on Python programming however I know R, PhP, Javascript, HTML including Java that I'm working at for a project.
Getting solutions to common issues with help of programming knowledge brings me fulfilment, my big desire is to grow as an IT specialist who provides solutions.
I hope to work with my knowledge of tableau, MS excel, relational & non relational databases to process, store, analyze data to get solutions in the future. 
Knowledge I had to get to understand in the past, at school, on the internet, in books & when I talked to others must get me to provide these solutions. 
To contact me email jonramangwana@outlook.com.
