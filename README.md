Hi, I’m Jon Ramangwana.
I’m interested in Data analysis.
At present I work at a project, excited about learning Firebase no sql database for an Android App development project.
I wish to collaborate on data analysis work to provide insights that improve processes.
I prefer to focus on Python programming however I coded with R, PhP, Javascript, HTML, Java etc. in the past. 
Getting solutions to common issues with help of programming knowledge brings me fulfilment, my big desire is to grow as an IT specialist who provides solutions.
I hope to work with my knowledge of tableau, MS excel, relational & non relational databases to process, store, analyze data to get solutions in the future. 
Knowledge I had to get to understand in the past, at school, on the internet, in books & when I talked to others must get me to provide these solutions. 
To contact me email jonramangwana@outlook.com.
